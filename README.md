A lightweight module that enables Game Masters to generate multiple inline check rolls and actions with optional group headers. Rolls can be sent either to the in-game chat or directly to selected connected players.

When rolls are sent to players, a result window will track and display the outcomes of the requested rolls in real time.

Additionally, generated requests—including those with multiple groups—can be saved as inline links, allowing GMs to quickly reopen the request dialog with prefilled data.

The request dialog can be opened via the console or a macro using `requestRolls.GMDialog.open()`.
